# Recipe Search App

This is my recipe searching app, which I am hosting on netlify.
The url for the website is searchforrecipes.netlify.app

The app consists of a few parts:

First is the ability to search for recipes under multiple constraints such as the name of the food, type of food, etc.

The second is the implementation of user authentication to add the ability for users to save recipes to their account, which can be viewed later.
